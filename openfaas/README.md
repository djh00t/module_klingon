 # OpenFaaS Function: Klingon Serial Generator

 ## Overview

 This OpenFaaS function provides an API to generate unique hexadecimal serial numbers using the `klingon_serial` Python module. It is designed to be deployed as a serverless function within the OpenFaaS framework.

 ## Components

 - `wrapper.py`: The FastAPI application that serves the function's endpoints.
 - `handler.py`: The handler that generates the serial number.
 - `Dockerfile`: The container specification for building the function.
 - `requirements.txt`: The Python dependencies required by the function.

 ## Usage

 The function exposes an HTTP endpoint that returns a unique serial number when accessed. The serial number is a concatenation of the machine's MAC address, the process ID (PID), and the current time in epoch format with millisecond precision.

 ## Endpoints

 - `/`: The root endpoint that returns the serial number in JSON format by default. It can also return plain text or XML based on the `Accept` header.
 - `/favicon.ico`: An endpoint to serve the favicon.

 ## Running Locally

 To run the function locally, you can use `uvicorn`:

 ```bash
 uvicorn openfaas.wrapper:app --reload
 ```

 ## Deployment

 To deploy the function to an OpenFaaS cluster, you can use the provided `Dockerfile` to build the container image and then use the OpenFaaS CLI to deploy it.

 ## Testing

 You can test the function by sending HTTP requests to the deployed function's endpoint. For example, using `curl`:

 ```bash
 curl http://<openfaas-gateway-url>/function/klingon-serial
 ```

 ## Contributing

 Contributions to the function are welcome. Please ensure that any changes are accompanied by corresponding updates to the documentation and tests.
